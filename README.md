# PeakTap

Showing a nice mountain panorama and lets you search for anything in view:
- calculates the panorama and displays it (currently with a flat earth :)
- lets you click in the panorama to link to the map and see what is there
- lets you click in the map to change the viewpoint - visit other places

## Why is this better than other panorama apps?

- Allows you to see all the mountains around you, not only those the app thinks are interesting
- Also shows very far mountains (like the _Mont Blanc_ as seen from _Morges_ in Switzerland),
  which are often omitted in other apps
- You can also zoom in on mountains in the foreground, or villages
- Choose the place from which you want to see the panorama

It uses worldwide elevation data from https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/

Example screenshot of showing the horizon in the map and as a panorama:

# Next steps

I would like to implement the following:

- remove unused tiles from the cache to decrease memory usage
- display updates
  - add a 360-degree view on the bottom and let the user scroll fast using it
  - add translations
- more progress-info needs:
  - show precision on GPS-lock
  - when downloading map, show that it's decompressing instead of 
   sticking to "99%"
- having some buttons to enable/disable features:
  - make mountains higher (if they're far away) / lower (if you're in the Valais)
  - enable / disable earth curvature
  - showing the panorama in the direction the phone points 
  - height above current point (standard is 10m)
- load tiles from https://map.ineiti.ch for faster loading
- skip "Searching for GPS" by allowing the user to choose the standing point

## Bugs

- In telescope mode, when panning down, it wraps around. Should stop instead.
- correctly place pin (currently it's a bit off)

## Before release

- add paying voting option for next version

Other ideas are welcome...

- 2023-07-13
  - when starting up, there is often a moment when the polygon seems to have two points:
  this is because it still shows the old, pre-defined POI
  - when choosing a new POI on the map, also show "creating panorama"

- 2023-07-11
  - avoid loading twice the same tile
  - show "loading" texts
  - when clicking on the panorama, zoom in the top of the chosen area,
  put a cross in the middle, and let the user pan around

- 2023-07-09 
  - using another dataset which covers the whole earth
  - scrolling also adds the POI
  - tapping for a POI also scrolls, and thus hides the zoom
